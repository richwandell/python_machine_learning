My work with machine learning
=========

This repo is a personal repo that I am using to store my machine learning playground. 
Folders beginning with an underscore are my own algorithm implementations.
Folders without an underscore are using python machne learning libraries including sklearn and pybrain.

The data used has been taken from several places with citations included in the 
folder along with links to the original data.
