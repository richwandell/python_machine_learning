This folder is going to be used for my own implementations of machine learning algorithms done with using scipy or pybrain.

The data used has been taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of US Census Bureau data from 2004. The data was pre loaded into an sqlite database using adult_data table for the reference data and adult_test table for the test data.
